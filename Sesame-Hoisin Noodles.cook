Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the @mushrooms{4%oz} and @baby bok choy{10%oz}. Cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; thinly slice. In a bowl, combine the @rice vinegar{1 tbsp}, @mirin (salted cooking wine){1%tbsp}, @soy glaze{2%tbsp}, @hoisin sauce{2%tbsp}, 2 tablespoons of water, and as much of the @sambal oelek{1%tbsp} as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be.

Carefully add the @pasture-raised eggs{2} to the pot of boiling water and cook 7 minutes for soft-boiled, or until your desired degree of doneness. Leaving the pot of water boiling, using a slotted spoon or tongs, carefully transfer the eggs to a strainer. Rinse under cold water 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. When cool enough to handle, carefully peel the cooked eggs. Season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat the @sesame oil{1%tbsp} on medium-high until hot. Add the mushroom pieces in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned. Add the sliced bok choy and @east-asian style saut√©ed aromatics{3%tbsp} (carefully, as the liquid may splatter); season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until combined and the vegetables are softened. Turn off the heat.

To the pot of boiling water used to cook the eggs, add the @ramen noodles{0.5%lb}, stirring gently to separate. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and rinse under warm water 30 seconds to 1 minute to prevent sticking.

Add the cooked noodles and sauce to the pan of cooked vegetables. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until combined. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the finished noodles topped with the seasoned eggs. Garnish with the @black & white sesame seeds{1%tsp}. Enjoy!
